 The paper "Datasheets for Datasets" caused me to reflect a lot about the data that has existed in our world, currently exists, as well as what data in the future will look like. The paper argues that most all data is biased in the sense that the collection of the data itself is biased. I have thought of this unfair collection of data before in regards to how police brutality has a correlated relationship with race (i.e. police report higher data regarding people of color which then causes them to police neighborhoods of color at a higher rate). However, in reading this paper, I tried to think about instances where data in its purest form is truly free from bias, and none came to mind. I initially though about POS systems from stores (take target for example), and how their system directly reports data of purchases from its store. I then thought about the ways that this data could be inaccurate, and many came to mind. For example, shoplifted purchases would not be in the POS system.
